Hello everyone! Welcome to the AI4OpticalNets repository.

We are a team formed by teachers, researchers and students from the Applied Electromagnetim Laboratory, placed at the Federal University of Par√°, in Brazil.
We made several researchs focused on the use of AI techniques for optical networks management.
This repository contains the codes and datasets used in our researchs.
